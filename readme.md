# Drupal 7.x Custom Module

## Force Image-alt Fields in Drupal 7
This module injects some JS for logged in users which scans the page for 'image-alt' fields and attaches an HTML 5 required attribute which forces the browser to prevent form submissions/saves until that field is filled out. This is a simple way to enforce image alt tags site wide for websites concerned with accessibility compliance.
